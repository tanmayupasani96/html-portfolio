<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I am an aspiring developer with a Master's degree from the University of Hertfordshire, Uk. I am well versed in 
  3 languages and at beginner level in another. I love to challenge myself by constantly setting new goals and striving to 
  be excellent in the new field. I love being punctual and get along well with everyone even in new surroundings. I am
  determined to learn more, grow and strive to make myself better everyday. I love watching football and you can always 
  find me to have an interesting conversation about it!
